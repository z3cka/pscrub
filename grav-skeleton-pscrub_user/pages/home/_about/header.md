## Let the Spa Come to You
We would like to introduce you to our wonderful creation called Pelle Luminosa Body Scrub.  It’s an all-natural, sugar-based body scrub designed to both exfoliate and moisturize, making the skin look dewey and feel like butter.

We were frustrated that every scrub we tried had something about it that we just found dissatisfying.  Not enough oil, skin reactions, too expensive for very little product, etc, so we decided to create our own.  We have three scents- Brown Sugar, which is our signature scent, Tangerine and Lavender.  

Our ingredients have an amazing array of benefits in skin care.  They are rich in anti-oxidants that help prevent premature 
aging by boosting collagen production and speeding up cell regeneration.  They also fight off damaging free radicals to help 
reduce the appearance of stretch marks, sun damage, age spots and fine lines.  It’s natural, so it’s gentle enough for pregnant

women and even babies!

We are currently developing more scents and more products..
